# Etch-a-sketch

A basic Etch-a-sketch like web app. Uses basic HTML5, CSS, and Javascript to change tiles on a grid when the mouse is hovered over them.
This project allowed me to select, delete, and modify elements of the DOM as well as add data validation.

Added extra options like:

- Rainbow/Random color option
- Change grid size (16 to 64)
